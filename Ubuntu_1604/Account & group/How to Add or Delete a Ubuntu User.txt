How to Add or Delete a Ubuntu user

1.How To Add a User

	If you are signed in as the root user, you can create a new user at any time by typing:

		$ sudo adduser newuser

	
2.How To Grant a User Sudo Privileges

	You can see what groups your new user is in with the groups command:

		$ groups newuser
		
		Output
		newuser : newuser

	By default, a new user is only in their own group, 
	
	which is created at the time of account creation, and shares a name with the user. 
	
	In order to add the user to a new group, we can use the usermod command:

		$ sudo usermod -aG sudo newuser
	
	The -aG option here tells usermod to add the user to the listed groups.
	

3.Specifying Explicit User Privileges in /etc/sudoers
	
	If you are signed in using a non-root user with sudo privileges, type:

		$ sudo visudo
		
	
	Traditionally, visudo opened /etc/sudoers in the vi editor, 
	
	which can be confusing for inexperienced users. 
	
	By default on new Ubuntu installations, it should instead use nano, 
	
	which provides a more familiar text editing experience. 
	
	Use the arrow keys to move the cursor, and search for the line that looks like this:

		$ /etc/sudoers
		root    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
		
		
	Below this line, copy the format you see here, 
	
	changing only the word "root" to reference the new user that you would like to give sudo privileges to:

		$ /etc/sudoers

		root    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
		newuser ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

	
4.How To Delete a User

	You can delete the user itself, without deleting any of their files, by typing this as root:

		$ sudo deluser newuser
		
	
	If, instead, you want to delete the user's home directory when the user is deleted, 
	
	you can issue the following command as root:
	
		$ sudo deluser --remove-home newuser


	If you had previously configured sudo privileges for the user you deleted, 
	
	you may want to remove the relevant line again by typing:

		$ sudo visudo
		
		root    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
		newuser ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL   # DELETE THIS LINE
