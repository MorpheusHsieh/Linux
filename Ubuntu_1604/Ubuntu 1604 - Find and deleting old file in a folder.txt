How to find and deleting old file in a folder 


	$ find /path/to/directory/* -mtime +t -exec rm {} \;
	
	or
	
	$ find /path/to/directory/[filename prefix]* -mtime +t -exec rm {} \;
	
	
	where +t means the number of days before today, 
	
	i.e., if you want to delete files a week ago, then you should write +6.
