Setup SSH with public key authentication


  1.Login system using your account username and password.
  
  
  2.Create SSH key directory and change mode
  
    $ sudo mkdir -p ~/.ssh
    $ chome 700 ~/.ssh
    
    
  3.Generate a new key pair.
  
    You can use 'ssh-keygen' command to generate a new key pair,
    also can use a old key pair, if yes, skip this step.
    
    During the generation of public key pair, some question need to be answered, 
    you can press 'enter' key directly if you like to use default value.
  
      $ ssh-keygen
  
      
        Generating public/private rsa key pair.
        Enter file in which to save the key (/home/seal/.ssh/id_rsa):
        
        Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
        
        Enter same passphrase again:
        
        Your identification has been saved in /home/seal/.ssh/id_rsa.
        Your public key has been saved in /home/seal/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
        The key fingerprint is:
        c7:61:98:72:02:91:94:db:12:96:05:9d:59:91:aa:25 seal@seal-desktop
        The key's randomart image is:
        +--[ RSA 2048]----+
        |   .=O.+oo       |
        |    *.+ .o       |
        |   . +o.+ o      |
        |    E ++ o .     |
        |     =  S o      |
        |    .    .       |
        |                 |
        |                 |
        |                 |
        +-----------------+
      
    After key generation finished, two files, i.e. 'id_rsa' and 'id_rsa.pub', 
    will have founded in '~/.ssh' directory.
  
      
  3.Upload SSH public key to remote system
  
    'ssh-copy-id' command is a utility that can copy a public key to a remote server over SSH.
  
      $ ssh-copy-id [usernam]@[hostname]
    
    If you like to use a specific public key copy to remote server, 
    which need to provid the pathname and filename of the public key.
    
    e.g.,
    
      $ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub [usernam]@[hostname]
    
      
  4.SSH to remote system for test.

    Use 'ssh' command for test.
    
      $ ssh [username]@[hostname]
    
    If sccess, system will response message as follows:
    
      Welcome to Ubuntu 16.04.5 LTS (GNU/Linux 4.4.0-131-generic x86_64)
  
        * Documentation:  https://help.ubuntu.com
        * Management:     https://landscape.canonical.com
        * Support:        https://ubuntu.com/advantage
      ...
    
    If want to disconnect, just typing 'exit' command.
    
      $ exit
      logout
      Connection to u1604s closed.
      
      
  5.Disable SSH password authentication.
  
    For safety reason, we can disable password authentication of SSH.
    
    (1).Edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config file
    
        $ sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    
    (2).Disable password authentication
    
        Find follow string:
          
          #PasswordAuthentication yes
        
        Change as:
          
          PasswordAuthentication no
        
    (3).Enable pubkey authentication
    
        Find follow string:
          
          #PubkeyAuthentication no
        
        Change as:
          
          PubkeyAuthentication yes
