Change network interface from dhcp to static IP

Setting a static IP on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS


    In general, we often use SSH to manage multiple remote server at the same time.
    Therefore, we need to setting static IP address for these remote servers 
    to prevent the question of have no idea about connecting which IP address.
    
    For this goal, we need to edit network config file in following steps:
    
    
    1.Open network interfaces configuration file:
    
        $ sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
        [sudo] password for user:
    
        
        The file should look similar to the one below:
        
            # This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
            # and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).
            
            source /etc/network/interfaces.d/*
            
            # The loopback network interface
            auto lo
            iface lo inet loopback
            
            # The primary network interface
            auto enp0s3
            iface enp0s3 inet dhcp
        
        
        In last row, the 'enp0s3' is the network interface name, 'dhcp' (Dynamic 
        Host Configuration Protocol) means the IP address of this network interface
        was obtained randomly.
    
        
    2.Change network interface from DHCP to static IP
        
        In this step, we need to disable dhcp command line,
        and add static IP configuration.
        
        For disable dhcp, we just put '#' mark at the head of row.
        
        For add static IP configuration, we need to append For add static IP 
        configuration, we need to append multiple command lines into file, 
        included IP address, netmask, gateway, broadcast and dns-nameserver.
        
        Here is an example of a static IPv4 address 192.168.100.11 on the first 
        network interface enp0s3 and gateway IP 192.168.100.1.
        The server will use the free Google DNS servers 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 to for 
        name resolving.
    
        The content should look similar to the one below:
    
            source /etc/network/interfaces.d/*
            
            # The loopback network interface
            auto lo
            iface lo inet loopback
            
            # The primary network interface
            auto enp0s3
            #iface enp0s3 inet dhcp
            iface enp0s3 inet static
                address   192.168.100.11/24
                netmask   255.255.255.0
                gateway   192.168.100.1
                broadcast 192.168.100.255
                dns-nameserver 192.168.100.1 8.8.8.8
            
    
    3.Add hosts
    
        (1).Query hostname
        
            $ cat /etc/hostname
            [your hostname]
            
        (2).Append hostname and IP address
        
            $ sudo nano /etc/hosts
            
            Append static IP address and hostname into file, 
            it should look like as follow:

            
                127.0.0.1       localhost
                127.0.1.1       [your hostname]
                192.168.100.15  [your hostname]
                
            
            Save and quit the editor.
        
    
    4.Restart networking service
    
        $ sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
        [sudo] password for user: 
        [ ok ] Restarting networking (via systemctl): networking.service.
