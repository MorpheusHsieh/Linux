How to Upgrade Kernel to Latest Version in Ubuntu


Step 1: Check Installed Kernel Version
	
	To find the current version of installed kernel on our system we can do:

		$ uname -sr
		
	
Step 2: Upgrading Kernel in Ubuntu	


	To upgrade the kernel in Ubuntu, go to http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/ 
	
	and choose the desired version (Kernel 4.12 is the latest at the time of writing) 
	
	from the list by clicking on it.

	Next, download the .deb files for your system architecture, ex: v4.13.3
	
		$ cd ~/
		$ mkdir kernel
		$ cd kernel 
		$ wget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.13.3/linux-headers-4.13.3-041303_4.13.3-041303.201709200606_all.deb
		$ wget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.13.3/linux-headers-4.13.3-041303-generic_4.13.3-041303.201709200606_amd64.deb
		$ wget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.13.3/linux-image-4.13.3-041303-generic_4.13.3-041303.201709200606_amd64.deb
		
	Once you’ve downloaded all the above kernel files, now install them as follows:

		$ sudo dpkg -i *.deb

	Once the installation is complete, reboot your machine and verify that the new kernel version is being used:

		$ sudo reboot
		$ uname -sr

	And that’s it. You are now using a much more recent kernel version than the one installed by default with Ubuntu.

		
Summary

	In this article we’ve shown how to easily upgrade the Linux kernel on Ubuntu system. 
	
	There is yet another procedure which we haven’t showed here as it requires compiling the kernel from source, 
	
	which is not recommended on production Linux systems.

	If you’re still interested in compiling the kernel as a learning experience, 
	
	you will get the instructions on how to do it at the Kernel Newbies page.

PS:	在更新 kernel 後，PHP mongodb extension driver 會不見，要重新安裝。
