Change global environment variables


    Sometimes, we may need to add or modify the value of PATH variable for all 
    users.

    The modification of '/etc/environment' can let us achieve this goal.


    1.Edit '/etc/environment' file
    
        $ sudo nano /etc/environment
       
       
    2.Change environment settings
    
        We add a 'JAVA_HOME' variable as a example.
        
        The modified content is as follows:
        
            ...
            JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64"
            ...
        
    3.Reboot and reload settings
    
        After reboot and login again, you can type command:
        
            $ echo $JAVA_HOME
        
        It should show the value as follows:
        
            /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64
