Ubuntu 1804 - Configure Static IP Addresses


    Since Ubuntu 17.10 introduced a new network configuration tool 'NetPlan' to 
    manage network settings, Ubuntu 18.04 and 16.04 have completely different 
    network interface configuration methods.

    If you have heard of NetPlan, youâ€™re a step ahead of many. 
    
    If not, don't worry, we will introduce how to configure static IP address 
    in Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.
    
    
    1.Find out the default network configuration file:
    
      $ ls /etc/netplan/
      50-cloud-init.yaml
      
      As seen, the default network configuration file is '50-cloud-init.yaml'
      and it is a YAML file.
      
      
    2.Check the contents of this file:
    
    
      $ sudo nano /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml
      
      The content should look like the one below:

        # This file is generated from information provided by
        # the datasource.  Changes to it will not persist across an instance.
        # To disable cloud-init's network configuration capabilities, write a file
        # /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99-disable-network-config.cfg with the following:
        # network: {config: disabled}
        network:
            ethernets:
                enp0s3:
                    dhcp4: true
            version: 2

      
      Here is an example of a static IPv4 address 192.168.100.11 on the network 
      interface enp0s3 and gateway4 IP 192.168.100.1.
      The nameserver will use the gateway4 and Google DNS servers 8.8.8.8 for 
      name resolving.
      
      After edited, the content is as below:

        # This file is generated from information provided by
        # the datasource.  Changes to it will not persist across an instance.
        # To disable cloud-init's network configuration capabilities, write a file
        # /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99-disable-network-config.cfg with the following:
        # network: {config: disabled}
        network:
            ethernets:
                enp0s3:
                    addresses: [192.168.100.11/24]
                    gateway4: 192.168.100.1
                    nameservers:
                        addresses: [192.168.100.1,8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4]
                    dhcp4: no
            version: 2


    3.Save and Quit   
    
    
    4.Testing the Configuration
    
      Before apply the change, let's test the configuration first.
      Typing the command as below:

        $ sudo netplan try
        
      This command will validate the configuration before applying it.
      If it succeeds, the configuration will have accepted.
      If it fail, system will automatically revert to the previous working 
      configuration after 120 secs.  
      
      
    5.Applying the New Configuration
    
      You also can directly to applying the new options. 
      The command is as follows:
    
        $ sudo netplan apply
