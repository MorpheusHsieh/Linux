Setting the tab size in nano

    Nano is a text editor used on Linux based systems.
    
    Its default tab size is 8 spaces, but it is possible to change the tab size.
    
    There are three methods can change the tab size which are command line, 
    system configuration file and user configuration file.
    
    We will setting tab size from 8 to 4 spaces as example to demo these methods.

    1.Command line
    
      $ nano -T 4 /path/to/file
      
      or 
      
      $ nano --tabsize 4 /path/to/file
    
    2.User configuration file
    
        (1).Edit "~/.nanorc" file
      
            $ nano ~/.nanorc

        (2).Adds two rows of content as follows:
      
            set tabsize 4
            set tabstospaces
        
        (3).Save and Quit.
    
    3.System configuration file
    
      If current account need to use 'sudo' instruction to edit files that are 
      belong to root privilege, the second methods wiil be not working. 
      
      Because 'sudo' doesn't use the configuration settings of non-root account, 
      we need to add settings to system configuration, i.e. '/etc/nanorc'.
      
      The steps as follows:
      
        (1).Edit /etc/nanorc
        
            $ sudo nano /etc/nanorc
            
        (2).Change tabsize
        
            Find "# tabsize 8" string.
            
            Change as:
            
                set tabsize 4
            
            
        (3).Change tab as spaces
        
            Find "# set tabstospaces"
            
            Change as:
            
                "set tabstospace"
                
        (4).Save and Quit.
