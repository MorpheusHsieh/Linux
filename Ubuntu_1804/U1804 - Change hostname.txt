Change hostname


    Sometimes, we would like change the hostname of Ubuntu system to manager 
    these remote servers more convenience.
    
    In Ubuntu 18.04 LTS system, we can use the 'hostnamectl' command to see or 
    set system's host name. 

    The host name of Ubuntu 18.04 LTS is usually at '/etc/hostname' file.
    
    We also need to check '/etc/hosts' file, because maybe some hostname and IP 
    address pair have defined in it.

    Open the terminal window and type the following commands to set or change 
    host name on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.
    
    
    1.Display the current Ubuntu hostname
    
        The origin hostname is 'localhost'.

        Using 'hostnamectl status' command to show current hostname settings.
    
        $ hostnamectl status
        
           Static hostname: localhost
                 Icon name: computer-vm
                   Chassis: vm
                Machine ID: b112c3a5642842cd88fbfeed59b352b3
                   Boot ID: e81ded5dcd0b4e298ccd087ddd7ebf42
            Virtualization: oracle
          Operating System: Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS
                    Kernel: Linux 4.15.0-48-generic
              Architecture: x86-64
    
    
    2.Set system hostname
    
        Usage: hostnamectl set-hostname NAME
        
        We use a new hostname 'u1804' as an example.

        Type following commands:
        
            $ sudo hostnamectl set-hostname u1804
      
      
    3.Verify new changes:
    
        $ hostnamectl
    
           Static hostname: u1804
                 Icon name: computer-vm
                   Chassis: vm
                Machine ID: b112c3a5642842cd88fbfeed59b352b3
                   Boot ID: e81ded5dcd0b4e298ccd087ddd7ebf42
            Virtualization: oracle
          Operating System: Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS
                    Kernel: Linux 4.15.0-48-generic
              Architecture: x86-64

    
    4.Check '/etc/hosts' file
        
        If you have added IP address and hostname 'localhost' pair in '/etc/hosts'.
        
        You need to edit '/etc/hosts' file.
                
        $ sudo nano /etc/hosts
        
        Replace all of old hostname with the new one.
        
            
    5.Logout the system to changes take effect
    
        $ logout
        
        Now, the new hostname has already displayed on login prompt.
