Install Docker MQTT Broker


    Docker is one of the most widely used container application. 
  
    Docker MQTT Broker will help us have more control over our IoT envioriment.
  
    Maybe we can use the steps of this article to run the MQTT Broker on Docker 
    on the others system, e.g. Raspberry Pi 3, Amazon EC2, Google Cloud Platform 
    or Microsoft Azure.
  
  
    1.Create host machine diectorys
    
        $ mkdir -p ~/mqtt/config
        $ mkdir -p ~/mqtt/data
        $ mkdir -p ~/mqtt/log
    
    
    2.Run Dokcer MQTT Broker
    
        $ docker run -itd \
        --name mqtt  \
        -p 9001:9001 \
        -p 1883:1883 \
        -v ~/mqtt/config:/mqtt/config:ro \
        -v ~/mqtt/data:/mqtt/data \
        -v ~/mqtt/log:/mqtt/log \
        eclipse-mosquitto

      If you are the first time to run Docker MQTT Broker, 
      the image of 'eclipse-mosquitto' will be pulling to local host machine. 
      
      During the process the message should look like as follows:

        Unable to find image 'eclipse-mosquitto:latest' locally
        latest: Pulling from library/eclipse-mosquitto
        c87736221ed0: Pull complete 
        999415f1293d: Pull complete 
        49bdbb41aa39: Pull complete 
        Digest: sha256:c7999d77b7aeb0245ff34a42536526c25f48ccec42e12a96a5f2febb5d145618
        Status: Downloaded newer image for eclipse-mosquitto:latest
        1a0e27ea40391c6ef0dfb334343c8fd05fe069785ffe03a4d73d59640b38683c

      If the local repository of host machine already have same image, 
      system will only display one 64-bytes hexadecimal string.

      For example:

        1a0e27ea40391c6ef0dfb334343c8fd05fe069785ffe03a4d73d59640b38683c

        
      If you want to check pulled images. Typing command 'docker images'
        
        $ docker images
           
        REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
        eclipse-mosquitto   latest              0bbe14f95663        3 days ago          5.07MB
          
          
    3.List running Docker containers
    
      We can use 'docker ps' command to list all running contains.

        $ docker ps
        
        CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                             NAMES
        1a0e27ea4039        eclipse-mosquitto   "/docker-entrypoint.…"   19 minutes ago      Up 19 minutes       0.0.0.0:9001->9001/tcp, 0.0.0.0:11883->1883/tcp   mqtt

      If you want to list all running and stopped containers, 
      typing command as follows:
        
        $ docker ps -a
            
    
    4.Stopped Docker container
    
      Just typing 'docker stop [CONTAINER ID]'. For example:
        
        $ docker stop 1a0e27ea4039
        
        
      Check container has stopped.
        
        $ docker ps -a
            
        CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                     PORTS               NAMES
        1a0e27ea4039        eclipse-mosquitto   "/docker-entrypoint.…"   33 minutes ago      Exited (0) 2 minutes ago      
            
    
    5.Running container again.
    
        $ docker start 1a0e27ea4039
        1a0e27ea4039

      Check container is running.

        $ docker ps
        CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                             NAMES
        1a0e27ea4039        eclipse-mosquitto   "/docker-entrypoint.…"   40 minutes ago      Up 2 seconds        0.0.0.0:9001->9001/tcp, 0.0.0.0:11883->1883/tcp   mqtt


    6.Test
    
      For MQTT Broker test, there many ways to do this. 
      We can use the other machine to publish or subscribe topic of the Dokcer 
      MQTT Broker host machine. 
      
      Here we just provide the commands of publish and subscibe topic 
      instructions as a example.

        (1).Subscibe topic:
        
            We use topic 'test' as a example.
            Open one terminal command line window and typing commmand:
            
                $ mosquitto_sub -t test
        
        (2).Publish message:
        
            We use topic 'test' and message 'From host' as a example.
            Open another terminal command line window and typing commmand:
            
                $ mosquitto_pub -t test -m "From host"
            
            Then the first terminal window should have message 'From host'.
            
            If not, there is something wrong.
