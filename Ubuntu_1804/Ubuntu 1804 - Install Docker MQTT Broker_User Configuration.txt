Install Docker MQTT Broker_User Configuration


    Docker is one of the most widely used container application.
    
    We have introduced to run a simplest MQTT Broker Docker container in other article.

    Sometimes, we may wish to configure MQTT architecture according to own idea.
    At this moment, we need to use a custom configuration of Docker MQTT Broker.

    In this article, we will introduce the custom configuration file.    
    
    
    1.Create host machine configuration file
    
      To use a custom configuration file, 
      mount a local configuration file to the container's configuration file, 
      i.e. 'mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf', is necessary.
      
      Our local configration file also named 'mosquitto.conf' 
      and the configuration directory struct as follows:
      
        - mosquitto
            - config
                - mosquitto.conf
            - data
            - log

      We will make this struct and configuration file in account home directory, 
      the command as follows:
      
        $ mkdir -p ~/mosquitto/config
        $ mkdir -p ~/mosquitto/data
        $ mkdir -p ~/mosquitto/log
        $ nano ~/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf
        
      Add following content to 'mosquitto.conf' file:

        persistence true
        persistence_location /mosquitto/data/
        log_dest file /mosquitto/log/mosquitto.log
        
        
    2.Run Docker MQTT Broker
    
        The features of container is as follows:
                   
            
            A. Keep STDIN open even if not attached.
            
            B. Allocate a pseudo-TTY
            
            C. Run container in background and print container ID
            
            D. Publish a container’s port 1883 to the host port 1883 for TCP connection.
            
            E. Publish a container’s port 9001 to the host port 9001 for WebSocket connection.
            
            F. Bind mount a user configuration '~/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.cong'
            
            G. Assign a name to the container
            
        
        The command is as follows:
            
        
            $ docker run -itd \
            -p 1883:1883 \
            -p 9001:9001 \
            -v ~/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf:/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf \
            --name mqtt \
            eclipse-mosquitto

     
    3.Verify Docker MQTT Service
    
    
        (1).Check container is running.
        
            List running container

                $ docker ps
        
            The message should look like as follows:
        
                CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                            NAMES
                971303200da4        eclipse-mosquitto   "/docker-entrypoint.…"   6 minutes ago       Up 6 minutes        0.0.0.0:1883->1883/tcp, 0.0.0.0:9001->9001/tcp   mqtt
        
            
            If not, something are wrong, you need to find and fix it.

        
        (2).Enter docker container
        
            After Docker MQTT Broker is running, 
            you can enter the container to check user configuration file.
            
            Enter container:
            
                $ docker exec -it mqtt sh
                / # 
                
            The prompt change as  "\ #" means you have entered the container.
                
            If you want to display the content of 'mosquitto.conf', as follows:
            
                / # cat '/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf'
                

            If you want to exit docker container, typing 'exit' command.
            
                / # exit
                $
        

    4.Verify MQTT service
    
    
        (1).Enter container:
        
            $ docker exec -it mqtt sh
            / # 
            
            
        (2).Subscribe topic on MQTT Broker container:

            / # mosquitto_sub -t '#'
            
        
            Publish message from host machine:
        
                A.Open Chrome browser on host machine.
                
                B.Install Chrome application 'MQTTLens'.
                
                    It connects to a MQTT broker and is able to subscribe and publish to MQTT topics.
            
                C.Input parameters:
                
                    The parameters that need to be input are "Connection name" and "Hostname", 
                    then press 'save' button.
    
                D.Publish message.
                
                    Enter any topic and message, and press 'PUBLISH' button.
                    
                    Then you can find the message at step (2) terminal window.
                
                
        (3).Publish message from MQTT container:
        
            A.Subscribe topic on host machine 'MQTTLens' application.
            
                '#' means all topics. You only need to subscribe topic '#'.
            
            B.Enter MQTT container:
            
                $ docker exec -it mqtt sh
                / # 
            
            C.Publish message form MQTT container.
            
                Usgae: mosquitto_pub {[-t topic] [-m message]}
                
                For example:
                
                    / # mosquitto_pub -t test -m 'From MQTT container'
        
            D.Verify message from 'MQTTLens' application.
            
        
    5.List all running and stopped container
    
        $ docker ps -a


    6.List images
    
        $ docker images
