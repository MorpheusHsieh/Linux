	Be sure that /etc/localtime is linked to the correct zone file. 
	
	This is necessary not only for the localtime to be set correctly but also for other programs you may use. 
	
	
	You can do this by:
	
		$ ls -l /etc/localtime
	
	
	You can find the time zones listed in /usr/share/zoneinfo/ 
	
	and then you will need to find a major city that exists to your time zone. 
		
	If you live in a specialized time zone area these will be listed in sub-directories.
	
	
	To change your time zone, link /etc/localtime to the new zone file:
	
		$ ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/<Zone>/<SubZone> /etc/localtime
	
	e.g.
	
		$ ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Taipei /etc/localtime
