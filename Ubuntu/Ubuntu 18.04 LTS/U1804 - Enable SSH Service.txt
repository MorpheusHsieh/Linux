Enable SSH service on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS


    Secure Shell (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol used for secure 
    connection between a client and a server.

    If we want to use SSH protocol to connect a remote system, a SSH server 
    package is need to install on the remote system previously, and using a 
    local SSH client to connect the remote system.

    The operation system of a local (client) and a remote (server) machine can 
    be the same or different types, e.g. we can connect to a remote linux 
    system from a windows system or a another linux system through SSH protocol.

    For convenience of manage multiple remote system, administrator often use 
    SSH client to connect mutiple remote system to controlled or configured them 
    simutaneously.

    In Ubuntu system, the SSH server is called OpenSSH server. 
    The OpenSSH server program is available in the official package repository 
    of Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.

    In this article, We will explain how to enable SSH server on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.
    
    
    1.Update Ubuntu to the latest status
    
        $ sudo apt-get update
        $ sudo apt-get upgrade
        
        
    2.Install OpenSSH server package

        $ sudo apt-get install openssh-server
        
        
    3.Show status of SSH server
    
        $ sudo service ssh status	
        
        Now, the message should look like as follows:
        
        
        ● ssh.service - OpenBSD Secure Shell server
           Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/ssh.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
           Active: active (running) since Thu 2019-05-09 13:33:35 UTC; 59min ago
          Process: 831 ExecStartPre=/usr/sbin/sshd -t (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
         Main PID: 871 (sshd)
            Tasks: 1 (limit: 2320)
           CGroup: /system.slice/ssh.service
                   └─871 /usr/sbin/sshd -D

        
        If the status of SSH server is not 'active (running)', something is wrong!!! 
        
    
    4.Change settings
    
        Sometimes, you maybe need to change some settings,
        e.g., the listening port, or root login permission ... etc.

        You can edit '/etc/ssh/sshd_config' file.
        
        
            $ sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
            
            (do something ...)
            Save and quit.
            
            
    5.Stop/Start/restart SSH service
    
        Stop SSH servive
    
            $ sudo service ssh stop
            
        Start SSH servive

            $ sudo service ssh start
            
            
    6.Apply the changes by restarting or reloading SSH:

            $ sudo service ssh restart


    7.Enable/Disable SSH service
    
        In order to completely disable SSH service after reboot system.
        
            $ sudo systemctl disable ssh
            
            
        To enable SSH service again.
        
            $ sudo systemctl enable ssh
