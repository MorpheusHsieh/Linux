Install Portainer on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS - A Web-Based Docker UI 


    Portainer is a web-based application for Docker containers management.

    It provides a graphical interface helps us to manage our Docker containers 
    at a more convenience way.
    
    Portainer is a lightweight Docker container that runs on the Docker host. 
    
    Therefore, you can very easy to install it after the Docker host installed.
    
    In this article, I will show you how to install Portainer on the Docker host.
    
    I will be using Lubuntu 18.04 LTS with Docker CE installed as a example.
    
    So, letâ€™s get started.


    0.Update system and Upgrade packages
    
        Before installing any packages, 
        please update the system repository and upgrade packages.
        
        $ sudo apt-get update
        $ sudo apt-get upgrade
     
    
    1.Create volume to store portainer data
    
        We use 'portainer_data' as the volume name.
    
        $ docker volume create portainer_data
        
        
    2.Installl portainer 
    
        $ docker run -d \
        -p 9000:9000 \
        --name portainer \
        -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
        -v portainer_data:/data \
        portainer/portainer

        
        If you install Portainer for the first time, 
        the following message should display on the screen:
