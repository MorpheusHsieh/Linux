Folder share between Host Win7 and Guest Ubuntu 18.04 LTS 


    1.Outline
      
      Sometimes, we are used to use Windows as host OS and need to deploy 
      service or develop software system on Linux OS. 
      
      For this goal, VirtualBox is one of good option. 
      
      VirtualBox is a powerful x86 and AMD64/Intel64 virtualization product for
      enterprise as well as home use. It allows us to run multiple guest 
      operating systems on one host computer. 
      
      We maybe need to back up some file during constructing system architecture.
      
      One of simple way of back up is synchronize the file from host OS to guest 
      OS. Therefore, folder share between host OS and guest OS will be useful.
      
      This article will provide the steps of how to build shared folder between
      windows 7 (Host OS) and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Guest OS).
      
      In this article, we assume that an Ubuntu 18.04 LTS had created as the 
      virtual machine (VM) named as ‘U1804S’, and a non-root account 'user' had
      added.
    
    
    2. The steps of folder share on Windows
    
        (1). Open ‘settings’ window of VM.
        
        (2). Select ‘Shared Folders’ item.
        
        (3). Adds new shared folder. 
        
        (4). Then ‘Add Share’ window appears.
    
        (4). Key-in the parameters of ‘shared folders’.
        
            There are three parameters need to write which are 'Folder path', 
            'Folder Name' and 'Mount point'. 
            
            'Folder path' means the shared folders on host OS. 
            'Folder Name' means a alias of host OS shared folder, we will explain later. 
            'Mount point' means the shared folders on guest OS.
        
            For convenience purposes, we named they as 'HostFolder', 
            'MappingFolder' and 'GuestFolder' respectively.
        
            After fill out all parameters, also checked 'Auto-mount' item.
    
        Here, we finished the setup steps of shared folders of VirtualBox on 
        Windows environment.
    
    
    3. The steps of shared folder on Ubuntu
    
        (1).Install ‘VirtualBox Guest Additions’ package.
            
            There are two ways can use to install 'VirtualBox Guest Additions'
            package, the first is using 'apt-get' command, the second is using
            'guest addition ISO'.
        
            A.Using ‘apt-get’ command:
                
              Open a terminal window and typing command as below:
        
                $ sudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-utils
        
            B.Using ‘guest addition ISO’
        
              First, we need to create a folder to mount the 'guest addition ISO' file.
        
              Second, we execute 'VBoxLinuxAdditions.run' file after the 
              'guest addition ISO' will have mounted. 
        
              The detail commands as below:
        
                $ sudo mkdir -p /media/cdrom
                $ mount /dev/cdrom /media/cdrom
                $ cd /media/cdrom
                $ sudo ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run
        
        (2).Adds current account to ‘vboxsf’ group
        
            $ sudo usermod -aG vboxsf $(whoami)
        
        (3).Mount ‘Shared Folder’
        
            Before list the commands of this step, it's worth to mention that 
            the guest OS can't know which folders were shared on the host OS, 
            it is necessary to provide a mapping list in order to the guest OS 
            want to mount its folders to connect with host folders.

            Therefore, the Oracle VM VirtualBox Guest Additions provide one 
            command line management interface “VBoxControl”. 
            
            “VBoxControl” have many functions, one of them is listing all shared folders. 
            
            The “VBoxControl sharedfolder list” command can list all mappings. 
            
            The list has two columns data in each row, one is index number, 
            the other is the value of "Folder name" in fig 4. 
            
            This is why we assigned the value of “Folder name” in fig 4 as “MappingFolder”.
        
            The example of list all mappings as follow:
        
            A.Show “Shared Folder” list
            
              $ sudo VBoxControl sharedfolder list

              Shared Folder mappings (1):
                
              01 - MappingFolder
                
              The commands to mount host folders to connect with guest folders is as follows:
        
            B.Mount guest folder to host folder
        
              $ cd /home/user/
              $ sudo mkdir GuestFolder
              $ sudo chown user:vboxsf GuestFolder
              $ sudo chmod 775 GuestFolder
              $ sudo mount -t vboxsf MappingFolder /home/user/GuestFolder
        
              After mounted shared folder, you can touch a new empty file for test.
        
                $ cd /home/user/GuestFolder
                $ touce test.txt
        
              If you want to umount shared folders is as below:
              
                $ sudo umount -t vboxsf /home/user/GuestFolder
