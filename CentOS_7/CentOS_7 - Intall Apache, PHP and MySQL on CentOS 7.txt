Intall Apache, PHP and MySQL on CentOS 7 (LAMP)


1. Apache

	(1). Install Apache

		a. clean-up yum:

			$ sudo yum clean all

		b. As a matter of best practice weâ€™ll update our packages:

			$ sudo yum -y update

		c. Installing Apache is as simple as running just one command:
	
			$ sudo yum -y install httpd

			
	(2) Allow Apache through the firewall
	
		Allow the default HTTP and HTTPS port, ports 80 and 443, through firewalld:

			$ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=80/tcp

			$ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=443/tcp

		And reload the firewall:

			$ sudo firewall-cmd --reload

			
	(3) Configure Apache to start on boot
	
		And then start Apache:

			$ sudo systemctl start httpd

		Be sure that Apache starts at boot:

			$ sudo systemctl enable httpd

		To check the status of Apache:

			$ sudo systemctl status httpd

		To stop Apache:

			$ sudo systemctl stop httpd

			
	(4) Now, the error message will be displaying as follows:
    
		AH00558: httpd: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified 
		domain name, using localhost.localdomain. Set the 'ServerName' directive 
		globally to suppress this message.
	

		For solve this error, we need to change two file and restart the httpd service.
        

		(1).Change '/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf' file:
        
            A.Edit '/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf' file
            
                $ sudo nano /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
                
            B.Remark 'ServerName' row
            
                The modified content is as follows:
            
                    #.....
                    ServerName www.yourwebserver.com:80
                    #.....
            
            C.Save and Quit file.
            
            
        (2).Change '/etc/hosts' file:
        
            A.Edit '/etc/hosts' file
            
                $ sudo nano /etc/hosts
                
            B.Add IP address and ServerName data pair
            
                We use IP (x.x.x.x) and ServerName (www.yourwebserver.com) as a example.
            
                The modified content is as follows:

                    127.0.0.1		yourwebserver
                    x.x.x.x			www.yourwebserver.com
                
            C.Save and Quit file.    
            
            
        (3).Restart httpd:

			$ systemctl restart httpd.service
