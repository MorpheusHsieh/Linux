How to install php on CentOS 7


	PHP is the component of our setup that will process code to display dynamic content. 
	It can run scripts, connect to our MySQL databases to get information, 
	and hand the processed content over to our web server to display.

	We can once again leverage the yum system to install our components. 
	We're going to include the php-mysql package as well:
	
	
	1.Install php, php-mysql and phpMyAdmin
	
		$sudo yum -y install php php-mysql phpMyAdmin
		
		
		This should install PHP without any problems. 
	
		We need to restart the Apache web server in order for it to work with PHP. 
		You can do this by typing this:

		
	2.Restart httpd service
	
		$ sudo systemctl restart httpd.service
		
	
	3.Testing PHP5 / Getting Details About Your PHP5 Installation
	
		The document root of the default website is /var/www/html. 
		We will now create a small PHP file (info.php) in that directory and call it in a browser. 
		The file will display lots of useful details about our PHP installation, 
		such as the installed PHP version.
		
		$ vi /var/www/html/info.php

		<?php
		  phpinfo();
		?>
		
		Now we call that file in a browser (e.g. http://x.x.x.x/info.php)
		As you see, PHP5 is working, and it's working through the Apache 2.0 Handler, 
		as shown in the Server API line. 
		If you scroll further down, you will see all modules that are already enabled in PHP5. 
		MySQL is not listed there which means we don't have MySQL support in PHP5 yet.
		
		
	4.Getting MySQL Support In PHP5
		
		To get MySQL support in PHP, we can install the php-mysql package. 
		It's a good idea to install some other PHP5 modules as well as you might need them for your applications. 
		You can search for available PHP5 modules like this:
		
			$ yum search php

		Pick the ones you need and install them like this:
		
		
			$ yum -y install php-mysql

		In the next step I will install some common PHP modules that are required by CMS Systems like Wordpress, 
		Joomla and Drupal:
		
			$ yum -y install php-gd php-ldap php-odbc php-pear php-xml php-xmlrpc php-mbstring php-snmp php-soap curl curl-devel

		Now restart Apache2:
		
			$ systemctl restart httpd.service

		Now reload http://192.168.0.100/info.php in your browser and scroll down to the modules section again. 
		You should now find lots of new modules like curl etc there.
		
		
	5.phpMyAdmin installation

		phpMyAdmin is a web interface through which you can manage your MySQL databases.
		phpMyAdmin can now be installed as follows:
	
			$ yum install phpMyAdmin

		Now we configure phpMyAdmin. We change the Apache configuration so that phpMyAdmin allows connections not just from localhost (by commenting out the <Directory "/usr/share/phpmyadmin"> stanza):
		
			$ vi /etc/httpd/conf.d/phpMyAdmin.conf

			[...]
			Alias /phpMyAdmin /usr/share/phpMyAdmin
			Alias /phpmyadmin /usr/share/phpMyAdmin

			#<Directory /usr/share/phpMyAdmin/>
			#   <IfModule mod_authz_core.c>
			#     # Apache 2.4
			#     <RequireAny>
			#       Require ip 127.0.0.1
			#       Require ip ::1
			#     </RequireAny>
			#   </IfModule>
			#   <IfModule !mod_authz_core.c>
			#     # Apache 2.2
			#     Order Deny,Allow
			#     Deny from All
			#     Allow from 127.0.0.1
			#     Allow from ::1
			#   </IfModule>
			#</Directory>
			
			
			<Directory /usr/share/phpMyAdmin/>
					Options none
					AllowOverride Limit
					Require all granted
			</Directory>
			
			[...] 
			Next we change the authentication in phpMyAdmin from cookie to http:
			vi /etc/phpMyAdmin/config.inc.php
			
			[...]
			$cfg['Servers'][$i]['auth_type']     = 'http';    // Authentication method (config, http or cookie based)?
			[...]
			
			
		Restart Apache:

			$ systemctl restart  httpd.service

		Afterwards, you can access phpMyAdmin under http://192.168.0.100/phpmyadmin/:
