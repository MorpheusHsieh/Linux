GPG Key Used By The ELRepo Project


    The ELRepo Project uses a GPG key to sign all RPM packages that we release.
    
    Each RPM package that is released by the ELRepo Project is signed with a GPG 
    signature. 
    
    By default, yum and rpm will verify these signatures and refuse to install 
    any packages that are not signed or have bad signatures. 
    
    You should always verify the signature of a package before you install it. 
    
    These signatures ensure that the packages you install are genuine as 
    released by the ELRepo Project and have not been altered (accidentally or 
    maliciously) since their release.
    
    The key is included in the elrepo-release package and you can find it within 
    the /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ directory. (File RPM-GPG-KEY-elrepo.org)
    
    The key may be downloaded from this website and is also available on a public 
    key server (gpg.mit.edu).

    Users should verify the key by checking it's fingerprint matches the 
    fingerprint listed here before installing it:

        # gpg --quiet --with-fingerprint RPM-GPG-KEY-elrepo.org
        pub  1024D/BAADAE52 2009-03-17 elrepo.org (RPM Signing Key for elrepo.org) <secure@elrepo.org>
            Key fingerprint = 96C0 104F 6315 4731 1E0B  B1AE 309B C305 BAAD AE52
        sub  2048g/B8C66E6D 2009-03-17
    
    Once you are satisfied the key is authentic you can import it:

        # rpm --import RPM-GPG-KEY-elrepo.org
