GRANT SELECT on all tables to user


    I thought it might be helpful to mention that, as of 9.0, 
    
    postgres does have the syntax to grant privileges on all tables (as well as other objects) in a schema:
    
        =# GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO user;
        =# GRANT EXECUTE ON ALL FUNCTIONS IN SCHEMA public TO user;
        
        
        
        
        =# GRANT SELECT ON mytable TO PUBLIC;
        =# GRANT SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT ON mytable TO admin;
        =# GRANT SELECT (col1), UPDATE (col1) ON mytable TO miriam_rw;
