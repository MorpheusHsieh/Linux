Create Role


    1.Create a role that can log in, but don't give it a password:
    
        =# CREATE ROLE jonathan LOGIN;
        
    
    2.Create a role with a password:
    
        =# CREATE USER davide WITH PASSWORD 'jw8s0F4';
        
        (CREATE USER is the same as CREATE ROLE except that it implies LOGIN.)
    
    
    3.Create a role with a password that is valid until the end of 2004. 
    
      After one second has ticked in 2005, the password is no longer valid.
    
        =# CREATE ROLE miriam WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'jw8s0F4' VALID UNTIL '2005-01-01';
    
    
    4.Create a role that can create databases and manage roles:
    
        =# CREATE ROLE admin WITH CREATEDB CREATEROLE;
