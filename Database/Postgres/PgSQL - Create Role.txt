Examples

Create a role that can log in, but don't give it a password:

	=# CREATE ROLE jonathan LOGIN;
	
Create a role with a password:

	=# CREATE USER davide WITH PASSWORD 'jw8s0F4';
	
	(CREATE USER is the same as CREATE ROLE except that it implies LOGIN.)

Create a role with a password that is valid until the end of 2004. 

After one second has ticked in 2005, the password is no longer valid.

	=# CREATE ROLE miriam WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'jw8s0F4' VALID UNTIL '2005-01-01';

Create a role that can create databases and manage roles:

	=# CREATE ROLE admin WITH CREATEDB CREATEROLE;
