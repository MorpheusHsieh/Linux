Could not connect to server: Connection refused


I am trying to connect to a postgres database installed in a remote server 
	
using the following command:

	$ psql -h host_ip -U db_username -d db_name

	This the error that occurs:

	psql: could not connect to server: Connection refused Is the server running on host "" 
	
	and accepting TCP/IP connections on port 5432?

	
Answer:
		
		$ cd /etc/postgresql/9.x/main/
	
	open file named postgresql.conf
	
		$ sudo vi postgresql.conf
	
	add this line to that file
	
		listen_addresses = '*'
	
	then open file named pg_hba.conf
	
		$ sudo vi pg_hba.conf
	
	and add this line to that file
	
		$ host  all  all 0.0.0.0/0 md5
	
	It allows access to all databases for all users with an encrypted password.
	
	
	restart your server
	
		$ sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql restart
