            | Please choose the web server that should be automatically configured to   |
            | run phpMyAdmin.                                                           |
            |                                                                           |
            | Web server to reconfigure automatically:                                  |
            |                                                                           |
            |    [*] apache2                                                            |
            |    [ ] lighttpd                                                           |
            |                                                                           |
            |                                                                           |
            |                                 <ok>                                      |
            |                                                                           |
            +---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
        
        When prompted again to allow debconfig-common to install a database and configure select No.
        
            +------------------------+ Configuring phpmyadmin +-------------------------+
            |                                                                           |
            | The phpmyadmin package must have a database installed and configured      |
            | before it can be used.  This can be optionally handled with               |
            | dbconfig-common.                                                          |
            |                                                                           |
            | If you are an advanced database administrator and know that you want to   |
            | perform this configuration manually, or if your database has already      |
            | been installed and configured, you should refuse this option.  Details    |
            | on what needs to be done should most likely be provided in                |
            | /usr/share/doc/phpmyadmin.                                                |
            |                                                                           |
            | Otherwise, you should probably choose this option.                        |
            |                                                                           |
            | Configure database for phpmyadmin with dbconfig-common?                   |
            |                                                                           |
            |                  <Yes>                   <No>                             |
            |                                                                           |
            +---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
        
        After installing, run the commands below to logon to the database server to enable phpMyAdmin root logon.
