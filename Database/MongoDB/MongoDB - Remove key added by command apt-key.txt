How to remove key added by command apt-key?

    
    Sometime, we installed some different version of key, 
    therefore need to remove the older version key.
    
    In this article, we have installed two MongoDB keys which are v3.2 and v3.6, 
    and the MongoDB v3.2 key will be removed .
    
    
    1.List all keys that you added.
    
        Do this by the command:
    
            $ sudo apt-key list
    
        It will list all the keys that you have, with each entry looking like 
        this:
    
        /etc/apt/trusted.gpg

    2.Figured out which key to be removed and delete it.
    
        We can use the command "apt-key del <keyid>" to delete the target key.
        
        For example, the keyid of MongoDB 3.2 is "EA312927",
        
        we can remove it as follows:
        
            $ sudo apt-key del EA312927
            OK


        Then we can check the list to confirm whether the key of MongoDB 3.2 has 
        removed.


            $ apt-key list | grep MongoDB

            uid                  MongoDB 3.2 Release Signing Key <packaging@mongodb.com>
            uid                  MongoDB 3.6 Release Signing Key <packaging@mongodb.com>
            
        
        The list figures the MongoDB 3.2 key is still exist, 
        because there are two keys on the keyserver with the same keyid "EA312927"
        
        We delete keyid "EA312927" once again.
        
            $  sudo apt-key del EA312927
            OK

        Check the key list again.
        
            $ apt-key list | grep MongoDB
            uid                  MongoDB 3.6 Release Signing Key <packaging@mongodb.com>

        The MongoDB 3.2 key has be fully removed.
