Convert string type to float type in MongoDB


    Since $sum operation can not apply to calculate the sum of string type values,
    how to convert the filed type from string to float would be useful.

    The scenario of an example is as follows:
    
        1.The table name is "shipment"
        2.The target filed name is "No_Tax_Amount_NTD"
        3.Convert data type of "No_Tax_Amount_NTD" from string to float.
	
	
    Command:

	> db.shipment.find().forEach(function(doc) { 
		var value = parseFloat(doc.No_Tax_Amount_NTD); 
		doc.No_Tax_Amount_NTD = value; 
		db.shipment.save(doc); 
	});
