How to allow multi-user access mongodb using MongoCompass?

    Usually, we manage MongoDB from other remote host system.
    
    But, the default connection IP address of MongoDB is limited to only local 
    address.

    manage and operate.


    1.Edit "/etc/mongod.conf" file
    
        $ sudo nano /etc/mongod.conf
        
        
    2.Add bindIp 
    
        Find "bindIp: 127.0.0.1" string, and chanage like as follows:
    
        
            bindIp: [127.0.0.1, new_ip_addr1, new_ip_addr2, ...]
