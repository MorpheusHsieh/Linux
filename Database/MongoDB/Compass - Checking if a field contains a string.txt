Checking if a field contains a string

    Sometime, we want to query the data set that has contained one certain short 
    string in specified filed of data table.

    The example is to query the data set that has contained "*son*" string in 
    "username" field of "users" table.

    
    1.Operation of mongo shell

        Type following command at mongo shell.

            $ db.users.findOne({"username" : {$regex : ".*son.*"}});
	
    
    2.Operation of Compass
	
        (1).Click "users" table on left frame before starting query.
        
        (2).Type following command on Compass query bar.
