Dump mongodb collection and restore to another mongodb host


    1.Dump source collection
    
        We can use "mongodump" command to achieve the goal. 

        The syntax is as follows:
        
            $ mongodump -d [database name] -c [collection name] -o /path/to/local/file
        
        
        An example of database name of "mydb1" and collection name of "env_F5" 
        is as follows:
        
        Type following commands on source host machine command mode:
        
            $ mongodump -d mydb1 -c env_F5 -o env_f5

        
        When "mongodump" command is successful execution, two files, "env_F5.bson" 
        and "env_F5.metadata.json", will have been found at "/path/to/local/file".
        
        These two files called as dump files.
    
    
    2.Move dump files to destination machine.

    
    3.Restore dump files
    
        The syntax of restore dump file is as follows:
        
            $ mongorestore -d [target database name] -c [target collection name] [path/to/bson file]
    
        
        An example of restore dump file to destination host machine is as follows:
        
            $ mongorestore -d mydb1 -c env_F5 env_F5/mydb1/env_F5.bson
