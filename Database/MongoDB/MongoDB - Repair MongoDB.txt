        $ sudo -u mongodb mongod -f /etc/mongodb.conf --repair
        $ sudo start mongodb

    2.For mongod service

        $ sudo mongod --dbpath /var/lib/mongodb --repair
        $ sudo mongod --dbpath /var/lib/mongodb	
        
        
    3.Explanation
    
        When we need to repair MongoDB, using the command "mongod --repair" will 
        help us to do.
        
        (1).Stop mongod service
        
            Before repair the MongoDB, the service should be stopped in advanced.
        
            $ sudo service mongod stop
            
            
        (2).Repair MongoDB
        
            The syntax is as follows:
        
                $ mongod --dbpath [old DB path] --repair --repairpath [new DB path]
        
            An example of old DB path "/data/db" and new DB path "/data/db0" 
            is as follows:
        
                $ mongod --dbpath /data/db --repair --repairpath /data/db0
        

        During repair the database, system will create a mongod.lock file to 
        prevent the mongod service been starting and it will be removed after 
        the repair process is finished.
        
        The worth mention is that the owner of repaired database directories 
        whether is been changed to belongs root account.

        If so, the database will be starting failed.

        To find the starting failed reason, it is helpful to check over the last 
        record of log file.
        
        
    4.Restart mongodb 
    
        $ sudo systemctl enable mongod
        $ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
