Problem Description
	
	Users cant able to login to database server. Though it allow sysdba to login, it does not allow to run any query. 
	
	Sometimes it will show database is connected to an idle instance.

Changes
	
	Oracle has been forcefully shutdown at OS level or crashed.


CAUSE
	
	An orphaned shared memory segment belonging to the ORACLE_SID still exists from a previous instance startup.

	The command
	
		$ ps -ef | grep $ORACLE_SID

	shows no processes but with ORACLE_SID set the Oracle 'sysresv' utility shows a shared memory segment 
	
	for a non-existing instance, 
	e.g.

		$ sysresv

	IPC Resources for ORACLE_SID "TEST" :

	Shared Memory:
	ID              KEY
	5963794         0x00000000
	5996563         0x00000000
	6029332         0xb2e3c9ac
	
	Semaphores:
	ID              KEY
	No semaphore resources used
	Oracle Instance not alive for sid "TEST"
	

Solution

	On OS level, remove the orphaned shared memory segment using:

		ipcrm -m <problem shared memory id>

		$ ipcrm -m 5963794
		$ ipcrm -m 5996563
		$ ipcrm -m 6029332

		$sqlplus '/as sysdba'

	Connected to an idle instance.
