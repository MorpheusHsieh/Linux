Instance “PLSExtProc”, status UNKNOWN


Question:

	$ lsnrctl start
	Service "PLSExtProc" has 1 instance(s).
	  Instance "PLSExtProc", status UNKNOWN, has 1 handler(s) for this service...
	The command completed successfully

	

Ans:

	That is perfectly normal and expected. 
	
	Every entry in the SID_LIST section of listener.ora will show as status UNKNOWN. 
	
	That simply means the listener is taking your word for it because you listed it. 
	
	Contrast that to those that show a status of READY. 
	
	These come from the database instance itself registering itself with the listener. 
	
	Think of the listener as the desk clerk at a hotel. 
	
	The SID_LIST section of listener.ora is the night manager handing the clerk a list of hotel guests. 
	
	The clerk has no way of knowing the accuracy of the list and so status is UNKNOWN. 
	
	But if a guest walks up and says "my name is Bob. 
	
	If anyone calls for me I'll be in room 201", that is the database registering with the listener.
