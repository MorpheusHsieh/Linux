ORA-00942: table or view does not exist V$SQL


Database dictionary related or system tables (v_$sql in this case) are owned by Oracle sys user 

and needs special privileges to access them. 

You need to login to oracle database as sysdba user or get those privilages 

(your DBA might help you with this) to get access for the data dictionary views.

are respected. So, that means that table_owner has to regrant the right to select

So, try the following to grant the SELECT on all dictionay view so that you can use it in your pl/sql blocks.


	SQL> grant select any dictionary to USERNAME
